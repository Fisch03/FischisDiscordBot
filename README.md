# FischisDiscordBot
A small Discord Bot using [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) library.

#### WARNING: This Project is my first Node project and also my first Discord Bot, so expect Spaghetti Code and more!

##### ALSO WARNING: This bot is in German, but we plan to add English in the far Future.

Its current features are:
1. Fun Commands: Commands like howgay, lenny and catgirl
2. Games: Rock-Paper-Scissors and a labyrinth Game
3. Reddit: Get top posts from a specific Subreddit or a Random Subreddit
