# FischisDiscordBot
A small Discord Bot using [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) library.

#### WARNING: This Project is my first Node project and also my first Discord Bot, so expect Spaghetti Code and more!

##### ALSO WARNING: This bot is in German, but we plan to add English in the far Future.

Its current features are:
1. Getting Hot Subreddit Posts
2. Basic Fun commands

This Bot is Currently hosted on Glitch.com, so I included all the Glitch Files. To make sure that your Bot does'nt shut down itself. You 
will need a Website like [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com/). If you want to learn more about it you can use [this](https://anidiotsguide_old.gitbooks.io/discord-js-bot-guide/content/other-guides/hosting-on-glitchcom.html) awesome Tutorial, which 
Inspired me to do this thing!
